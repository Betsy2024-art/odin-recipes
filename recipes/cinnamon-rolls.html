    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make delicious, soft cinnamon rolls in no time with this easy, no-yeast recipe! Perfect for a last-minute breakfast treat—no rising time required</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For the Brown Sugar Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup dark brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the dough</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled off with knife, plus more for dusting work surface</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1¼ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1¼ cups low fat buttermilk</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 425°F. Line a 9-inch square cake pan with aluminum foil and brush with one tablespoon butter.</li>
        <li>Combine the brown sugar, 3 tablespoons granulated sugar, cinnamon, cloves and ⅛ teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Add one tablespoon of the melted butter and stir with a fork or fingers until the mixture resembles wet sand. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, remaining tablespoon granulated sugar, baking powder, baking soda and 1 teaspoon salt. Add the buttermilk and 3 tablespoons of the melted butter to the dry ingredients and stir with a wooden spoon until the liquid is absorbed; the dough will be sticky and shaggy. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Knead, lightly dusting more flour as necessary, until just smooth and no longer shaggy, about 1 minute. </li>
        <li>Lightly dust the surface again. Pat the dough into a small rectangle, then roll into a 12x9-inch rectangle, dusting more flour sparingly if necessary so the dough doesn't stick to the rolling pin. Brush the dough with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter. Sprinkle the dough evenly with the brown sugar filling, leaving a ½-inch border. Using your hand, press the filling firmly into the dough. Starting at the long side, roll the dough, pressing lightly, to form a tight log. (If the dough sticks to the surface, use a sharp knife or dough scraper to release it.) Pinch the seam to seal. Roll the log seam-side down and, using a sharp knife, cut it evenly into 9 pieces. Turn the pieces over on their flat sides, and slightly flatten each piece with your hand to seal the open edges and keep the filling in place. Place the rolls in the prepared pan and brush with the remaining butter. Bake until the edges are golden brown, 23 to 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the rolls are done, use the foil overhang to lift them out of the baking pan and onto a wire rack. Let cool for 5 minutes, then carefully separate the rolls, using a knife if necessary. If you find the rolls are sticking a bit to the foil, transfer them to a wire rack. The rolls are best served warm; leftovers may be stored in an airtight container at room temperature.</li> 
    </ol>
