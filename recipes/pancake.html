    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>Rise and shine! This easy pancake recipe makes the perfect pancakes: fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside.</p> 
    <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned into measuring cup and leveled off</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1½ cups milk, plus more if necessary</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled, plus more for cooking</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil, for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and milk until evenly combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the milk/egg mixture and the melted butter into the dry ingredients and whisk until just combined. If the batter seems too thick, add 1 to 2 tablespoons more milk.</li>
        <li>Heat a griddle or nonstick pan over medium heat; coat it lightly with vegetable oil and swirl in a thin pat of butter. Ladle or drop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately ¼ cup for each pancake; cook until the first side is golden brown, or until the top surface bubbles and is dotted with holes. Flip and cook until the other side is golden brown. This happens quickly so peek after 30 seconds and watch carefully! Adjust the heat setting if necessary. Wipe the griddle clean with a paper towel between batches. Serve immediately with maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
